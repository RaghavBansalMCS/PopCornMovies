    - API Website - https://www.themoviedb.orgÂ 

## Table of Contents

   - In the structure files contains: Model, View, ViewModel, Network, CoreData and Tests. 
   - Model -> Its the dataModel which I used to get the data from API and display on the views
   - View  -> It shows the Views of my Application, how every page of the application will look
   - ViewModel -> It Communicates with the Network to fetch the data and pass on to the View
   - Network -> It is used to get the API Calls to get the data to pass to the ViewModel
   - CoreData -> It is used to store some data in offline Storage
   - Tests ->  Tests contains ViewModelTests


# Installation
   Can be used with Xcode 14.3 and above. Compatible with iPhone and iPad with minimum iOS version 16.0.

# Framework
   - SwiftUI 
   - Alamofire
   - CoreData
   - AlertToast
   - Image Caching(NSCache), AysncImage
   

# Architecture
   - MVVM- This application uses MVVM for the views and Alamofire for the URL calls.

# Offline Storage
  - Core Data -> The use of Core Data is On the Home Page to Store movie data of whichever movie the user want to save.

# Security 
    Implemeantaion
    1. Jailbroke detection

    - iOS Security options Discussion:
         1.Data Storage Security
         2.Network layer Security
         3.Jailbroken Detection
         4.Development techniques or best practices
         5.Code secuirty scans using blackduck sites

# Design Patterns
    - Singleton - It is used in the View Model to use the generic Network Manager in distinct functions attached to distinct data models and API Calls

# Testing
    TDD:
    Units tests for success and failure situations. Faked responses using FakeNetworkManager using test jsons. Written test cases for view model testing
    BDD:
    Also have written test cases using Qucik and Nimble framework
    for ViewModel

# Accessibility
   1. Added accessiblity for Voice Over and Dynamic fonts using accessiblityLabel,accessiblityValue,accessiblityTrait,accessiblityHint
